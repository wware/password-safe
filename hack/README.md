Overview
====

This is some stuff I prototyped on plnkr.co (Plunker) but I find you can do exactly the same
thing on any normal laptop or desktop. Things like Plunker and JSfiddle are handy for getting
something started or finding CDN libraries of popular stuff (Angular/jQuery/Bootstrap) but are
then unnecessary, unless you're working on a phone or tablet or chromebook.

This represents a little bit of a rethink, in terms of trying to do a lot of front-end work
first, including designing the crypto-synchronizer. I also set up block chaining in Rijndael
and that appears to be working correctly.

My general idea at this point is to merge this with the earlier stuff.
