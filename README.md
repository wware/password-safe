Password vault web app
==

The idea here is an offline HTML5 app that keeps my various passwords in
encrypted form, and syncs with the server when it's possible to do so. The app
should work on a Macbook, a phone, and a tablet, so some responsive CSS may be
required. Encryption will be via
[Ciphersaber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CipherSaber).
